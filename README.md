# BenderCO

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.

Credit is due to [Ryan Fitzegeral]{https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio} for creation of a Tech Portfolio Template.

This was originally based off of Ryan Fitzegeral's but has since been replaced with an new Angular Template.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
