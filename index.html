						<p>
                            Worked in the software industry for 13+ years 11+ of which is with web-enabled clients, ranging vastly in multinational conglomerates to start-up companies. The most 
                            important thing for me in a career is enjoying the people I work with and what I do.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In addition, working at a company where a career path is transparent and communication on said career path is open and a regular discussion. Lastly, working with a 
                            modern technology stack (Microsoft's stack of Azure, C# and Angular/Typescript) is a very important factor in my career.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I have managed 3 direct reporting engineers and I have led teams ranging in sizes of 4 engineers/2 QA to 8 engineers/5 QA. Both of these experiences deal with individuals 
                            spread across all seniority levels/titles, regions time zones and multilingual/multinational teams. I have also participated in 8+ greenfield startups from POC to MVP, 
                            always striving for production release. My leadership style is very hands-on being with the team through thick and thin in the trenches with them.
